It’s a great podcast for anyone who is learning about machine learning, it can be useful for a complete beginner, an enthusiast, or someone who is looking to further even more on this topic.\nThe show starts by talking about what is data science, how it relates to machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also talks about the first attempts humans had made to create AI, with some examples coming from as early as the 13th century.\nI like that the show talks about concepts of machine learning in a different way than I’m used to. When people are talking about machine learning, as a Statistician, I always feel that I understand what people are talking about, except I never knew the keywords they were using. What machine learning engineers might call features I was taught as variable, so I got confused when talking to friends about machine learning when they came from a different background as me (e.g. computer science). This is one of the reasons why I like the podcast so much because it talks about deep details about every machine learning concept so if it is talking about something that I already know I can now make that connection.\n","wordCount":"242","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-01-24T18:15:00-03:00","dateModified":"2022-01-24T18:15:00-03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jaqueline Souza Medeiros"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://devmedeiros.com/post/2022-01-24-podcast-review-mlg/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dev_Medeiros","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://devmedeiros.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://devmedeiros.com/ accesskey=h title="Dev_Medeiros (Alt + H)">Dev_Medeiros</a>
