      <description>The Alura Challenge BI 2 was a four-week event where we&amp;rsquo;re challenged to make Business Intelligence dashboards according to the request of three made-up companies. During the event I made this three dashboard using Power BI, you can look at the source file of all dashboards at my repo.
Alura Films Alura Food Alura Skimó The objective of this dashboard is to help find the best selection for an upcoming movie.</description>

      <description>What is feature selection? Feature selection is the process of finding pertinent features and eliminating unnecessary, redundant, or noisy data. It can be useful to help the training process be faster and it can also avoid overfitting. According to Munson and Caruana, the goal of feature selection is to identify the feature set that best balances the risks of having too few features with the risks of having too many features.</description>

      <description>What is UX/UI? UX is the acronym for User Experience, it is a recent concept about making design decisions while thinking about the user experience. The UX designer needs to be concerned about whether their product is easy to use and intuitive, making changes to it whenever necessary to suit the user&amp;rsquo;s needs.
UI stands for User Interface. It is everything involved in the interaction of the user and the product.</description>

      <title>Storytelling with CEAP</title>

      <description>The Dataset CEAP stands for Cota para o Exercício da Atividade Parlamentar, in English, Exercise of Parliamentary Activity from Brazil. The quota is a monthly amount that can be used by the deputy/senator to defray typical expenses of the exercise of the parliamentary mandate.
The monthly amounts don&amp;rsquo;t accumulate over the months. Another important thing is Senators in Brazil have an 8-year mandate, and there are elections every 4 years.</description>

      <title>Comprehending the P Value</title>

      <guid>https://devmedeiros.com/post/2022-04-12-comprehending-the-p-value/</guid>
      <description>What is the p-value? In statistics, we have hypothesis tests, which are made to decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. Some examples of hypothesis testing are Neyman-Pearson, Shapiro-Wilk, Student&amp;rsquo;s T-test, and others.
All hypothesis tests have a test statistic specific to them. And this statistic is used to evaluate the test, but this task can be tiring even with the use of computers because most software does not return the comparison statistic as an output, only the sample statistic.</description>

      <description>Recently I finished an Alura course named Python for Data Science and I want to put what I learned into practice, to do so I&amp;rsquo;ll make a descriptive analysis on this dataset Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2019. It contains 550 books and the data has been categorized as fiction and non-fiction by Goodreads. All of the code can be found here.
I started checking the first five observations from the dataset.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m learning data visualization in Python and I see myself as a &amp;lsquo;hands on&amp;rsquo; learner, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be reproducing some basic plots using seaborn package that you can use as a reference everytime you need to fresh up your memory.
At first is required that the packages are properly imported, after that I load the iris dataset.
import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt url = &amp;#34;https://git.</description>

      <title>An Overview on data.table R Package</title>

      <description>The data.table package is one of the fastest packages for data manipulation, currently, it is even faster than pandas and dplyr 1. data.table syntax is dt[i, j, by], where:
i is used to subset rows j is used to subset columns by is used to subset groups, like GROUP BY from SQL You can read it out loud as2:
Take dt, subset/reorder rows using i, then calculate j, grouped by by.</description>

      <description>I want to tackle sentiment analysis using R in a simple way, just to get me started. With this in mind we begin loading all the packages we&amp;rsquo;ll be using.
library(readr) library(dplyr) library(tidytext) library(tokenizers) library(stopwords) library(ggplot2) Then we need to load our dataset. This data comes from Kaggle Fake and real news dataset.
Fake &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;#39;~/fakenews/Fake.csv&amp;#39;) True &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;#39;~/fakenews/True.csv&amp;#39;) I want to merge the two datasets, but first we need to create a new column that will tell me where the data came from.</description>

      <description>Python Guide for R Users is an upcoming project where I&amp;rsquo;m writing a guide to Python to help people who already know how to program in R or are just familiar with it and are learning/transitioning to Python.
The project is going to be available here. Feel free to contribute to the project if you notice anything missing or incorrect.</description>
