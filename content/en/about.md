Hi! My name is Jaqueline Medeiros and I'm an Analytics Engineer from Brazil. {{< round-image "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33239902?v=4" "jaqueline medeiros analytics engineer">}} I've always liked learning new things and exploring new possibilities and this blog is an outlet for me to create and discover new things related to Data Science. 

I want to write posts that people can read without a technical background, but I also want to showcase and talk about the coding aspects of what I'm currently learning, so you'll be able to find a little bit of everything here.

You can find me at:
