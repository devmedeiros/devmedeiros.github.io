![Machine Learning Guide Podcast Cover](https://ik.imagekit.io/devmedeiros/mlg-capa_4H_gyNxIV.jpg#center)

The show is presented by Tyler Renelle from Depth, since 2021 it has been redone to update the content. The podcast offers a [resource](https://ocdevel.com/mlg/resources) list where you can find all of the books, courses, and sites mentioned during the podcast. It's a great podcast for anyone who is learning about machine learning, it can be useful for a complete beginner, an enthusiast, or someone who is looking to further even more on this topic.

The show starts by talking about what is _data science_, how it relates to _machine learning_ and _artificial intelligence_. It also talks about the first attempts humans had made to create AI, with some examples coming from as early as the 13th century.

I like that the show talks about concepts of machine learning in a different way than I'm used to. When people are talking about machine learning, as a Statistician, I always feel that I understand what people are talking about, except I never knew the keywords they were using. What machine learning engineers might call _features_ I was taught as _variable_, so I got confused when talking to friends about machine learning when they came from a different background as me (e.g. computer science). This is one of the reasons why I like the podcast so much because it talks about deep details about every machine learning concept so if it is talking about something that I already know I can now make that connection.
