Hi! :wave: My name is Jaqueline Medeiros and I'm a Data Analyst from Brazil. I've always liked learning new things and exploring new possibilities and this blog is an outlet for me to create and discover new things related to Data Science.

I want to write posts that people can read without a technical background, but I also want to showcase and talk about the coding aspects of what I'm currently learning, so you'll be able to find a little bit of everything here.

You can find me at:
