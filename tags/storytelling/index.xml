      <description>I was challenged to take the role of a new data scientist hired at Alura Voz. This made-up company is a telecommunication company and it needs to reduce the Churn Rate.
The challenge is divided into four weeks. For the first week, the goal was to clean the dataset provided by an API. Next, we need to identify clients who are more likely to leave the company, using data exploration and analysis.</description>

      <description>What is UX/UI? UX is the acronym for User Experience, it is a recent concept about making design decisions while thinking about the user experience. The UX designer needs to be concerned about whether their product is easy to use and intuitive, making changes to it whenever necessary to suit the user&amp;rsquo;s needs.
UI stands for User Interface. It is everything involved in the interaction of the user and the product.</description>

      <description>The Dataset CEAP stands for Cota para o Exerc√≠cio da Atividade Parlamentar, in English, Exercise of Parliamentary Activity from Brazil. The quota is a monthly amount that can be used by the deputy/senator to defray typical expenses of the exercise of the parliamentary mandate.
The monthly amounts don&amp;rsquo;t accumulate over the months. Another important thing is Senators in Brazil have an 8-year mandate, and there are elections every 4 years.</description>
