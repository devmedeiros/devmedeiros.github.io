      <description>What is UX/UI? UX is the acronym for User Experience, it is a recent concept about making design decisions while thinking about the user experience. The UX designer needs to be concerned about whether their product is easy to use and intuitive, making changes to it whenever necessary to suit the user&amp;rsquo;s needs.
UI stands for User Interface. It is everything involved in the interaction of the user and the product.</description>

      <description>The Dataset CEAP stands for Cota para o Exercício da Atividade Parlamentar, in English, Exercise of Parliamentary Activity from Brazil. The quota is a monthly amount that can be used by the deputy/senator to defray typical expenses of the exercise of the parliamentary mandate.
The monthly amounts don&amp;rsquo;t accumulate over the months. Another important thing is Senators in Brazil have an 8-year mandate, and there are elections every 4 years.</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Tools used: Power BI, Figma, SQL
Category: Dashboard
This dashboard is the last out of three from the second Alura Challenge BI.
Alura Skimo is interested in analyzing their sales data, to help with this I made this dashboard. It’s composed of three pages. The first one presents a summary of all the main measures you’ll find in the dashboard, filtered for the most recent month. On this first page, you can also rest your mouse cursor over a measure and it’ll show a small plot with the historical series with a tendency line.</description>

Category: Dashboard
This dashboard is the second of three that I&#39;m making in the following weeks as part of the second Alura Challenge BI.
Alura Food is interested in expanding its business by entering the Indian market. To do so, the company asked to calculate measures to help them make a better decision.
First of all, I merged the datasets and cleaned the data through Power BI, translated a few texts from English to Portuguese through Google Sheets, and converted the meals price from their respective currency value to BRL (Brazillian Currency).</description>

This dashboard is the first of three that I&#39;ll be making in the following weeks as part of the second Alura Challenge BI.
The objective of this dashboard is to help find the best selection for an upcoming movie.
With this in mind, I explored in the first tab a little summary about the movies in the database, with this you can get a general view of our data.</description>

      <description>Recently I finished an Alura course named Python for Data Science and I want to put what I learned into practice, to do so I&amp;rsquo;ll make a descriptive analysis on this dataset Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2019. It contains 550 books and the data has been categorized as fiction and non-fiction by Goodreads. All of the code can be found here.
I started checking the first five observations from the dataset.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m learning data visualization in Python and I see myself as a &amp;lsquo;hands on&amp;rsquo; learner, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be reproducing some basic plots using seaborn package that you can use as a reference everytime you need to fresh up your memory.
At first is required that the packages are properly imported, after that I load the iris dataset.
import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt url = &amp;#34;https://git.</description>
