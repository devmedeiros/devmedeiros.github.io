 This dashboard is the last out of three from the second Alura Challenge BI.
 Alura Skimo is interested in analyzing their sales data, to help with this I made this dashboard. It’s composed of three pages. The first one presents a summary of all the main measures you’ll find in the dashboard, filtered for the most recent month. On this first page, you can also rest your mouse cursor over a measure and it’ll show a small plot with the historical series with a tendency line.</description>

 This dashboard is the second of three that I&#39;m making in the following weeks as part of the second Alura Challenge BI.
 Alura Food is interested in expanding its business by entering the Indian market. To do so, the company asked to calculate measures to help them make a better decision.
First of all, I merged the datasets and cleaned the data through Power BI, translated a few texts from English to Portuguese through Google Sheets, and converted the meals price from their respective currency value to BRL (Brazillian Currency).</description>

 This dashboard is the first of three that I&#39;ll be making in the following weeks as part of the second Alura Challenge BI.
 The objective of this dashboard is to help find the best selection for an upcoming movie.
With this in mind, I explored in the first tab a little summary about the movies in the database, with this you can get a general view of our data.</description>
